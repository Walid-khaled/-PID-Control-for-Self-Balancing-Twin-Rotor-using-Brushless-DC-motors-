## PID-Control-for-Self-Balancing-Twin-Rotor-using-Brushless-DC-motors
In this repository,PID control is applied to twin rotor using brushless DC motors for self balancing applications. First, it is designed on solidworks, then manufacturing, and finally controlled with Arduino uno. The calibration for the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) that controls the brushless motor is done and codes are attached.
